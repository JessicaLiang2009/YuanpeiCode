# Medical Image Diagnosis using Deep Learning
This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of developing medical image diagnosis algorithms using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It is designed for educational purposes to help students understand the complete pipeline of medical AI development and includes advanced features for scientific research.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for medical image diagnosis (both classification and regression tasks), including:

1. Image Preprocessing: Histogram equalization, Contrast enhancement, Gaussian smoothing, Image resizing, Visualization of preprocessing effects

2. Dataset Management: Custom dataset class for medical images, Train/validation/test split, Data augmentation, DataLoader implementation

3. Model Architecture: Custom CNN architecture, Training pipeline, Early stopping, Model checkpointing, Class name mapping for better visualization

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search implementation, Parameter optimization, Results visualization, Best model selection

5. Model Comparison & Benchmarking: Deep Learning (CNN) vs Traditional ML methods, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression comparison, Feature extraction from pre-trained CNN, Scientific-quality performance visualization

6. Advanced Evaluation and Visualization: Training history plots, Confusion matrix with custom class names, Classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1), ROC and Precision-Recall curves, Scientific paper-quality figures, Performance comparison charts
